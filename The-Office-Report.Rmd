Here's a plot of average IMDB rating for each season of The Office. 
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load library
library("schrute")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")

# Load The Office data
office_df <- theoffice

# Which season of The Office was the best?
# Calculate the average IMDB rating for each season
rating_per_season <- office_df %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

# Now plot the average IMDB rating for each season as a scatterplot, a line plot, or a bar plot
ggplot(data = rating_per_season) +
  geom_line(aes(x=season, y = avg_rating))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Calculate average IMDB rating and pull the value
avg_rating <- NULL
```

The average IMDB rating for The Office episodes is: `r avg_rating`.
