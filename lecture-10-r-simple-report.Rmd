    1. Give the report a new title and add your own name
    2. Calculate the average age for all Survivor contestants
    3. Show the code and output from the last cell

Here's the distribution of ages for Survivor contestants.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

castaways <- read.csv("https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/raw/main/Survivor-Castaways.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Extract the "age" column
ages <-
# Make a histogram plot of ages
hist(ages)
# Calculate average age
avg_age <- 
```

The average age of Survivor contestants is: `r avg_age`.

To calculate the maximum and minimum, we can use the following code:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
print(max(ages))
print(min(ages))
```
